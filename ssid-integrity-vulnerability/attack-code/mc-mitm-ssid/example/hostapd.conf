# ACS tuning - Automatic Channel Selection
# See: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/documentation/acs
#
# You can customize the ACS survey algorithm with following variables:
#
# acs_num_scans requirement is 1..100 - number of scans to be performed that
# are used to trigger survey data gathering of an underlying device driver.
# Scans are passive and typically take a little over 100ms (depending on the
# driver) on each available channel for given hw_mode. Increasing this value
# means sacrificing startup time and gathering more data wrt channel
# interference that may help choosing a better channel. This can also help fine
# tune the ACS scan time in case a driver has different scan dwell times.
#
# acs_chan_bias is a space-separated list of <channel>:<bias> pairs. It can be
# used to increase (or decrease) the likelihood of a specific channel to be
# selected by the ACS algorithm. The total interference factor for each channel
# gets multiplied by the specified bias value before finding the channel with
# the lowest value. In other words, values between 0.0 and 1.0 can be used to
# make a channel more likely to be picked while values larger than 1.0 make the
# specified channel less likely to be picked. This can be used, e.g., to prefer
# the commonly used 2.4 GHz band channels 1, 6, and 11 (which is the default
# behavior on 2.4 GHz band if no acs_chan_bias parameter is specified).
#
# Defaults:
#acs_num_scans=5

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either

# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
