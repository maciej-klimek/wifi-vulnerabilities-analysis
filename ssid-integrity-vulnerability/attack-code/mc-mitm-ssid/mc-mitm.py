# --- PERFORMANCE REMARKS ---
#
# We use BFP packet filers so that only relevant Wi-Fi frames reach our script. Otherwise
# the performance of Python/Scapy is way too slow, especially when there's a lot of
# background traffic.
#
#
# --- CURRENT FRAME INJECTION APPROACH ---
#
# See also https://github.com/vanhoefm/wifi-injection
#
# AP: To clone the legitimate AP on another channel we use `iw`:
#
#     - We put the interface in AP mode (using "iw set wlan0 type __ap") and then
#       use the "start ap" command to let it broadcast beacons. This assures the
#       interface will send acknowledgements and it should retransmit frames.
#
#     - A virtual monitor interface is used to recieve and inject arbitrary frames
#
#     - TODO: It may be useful to add clients to the kernel when they are connecting?
#             o I'm not sure if rate control is done properly without adding STA info
#               to the kernel. We could do this ourselves in RadioTap but that's tedious.
#             o The client may go into sleep mode. I'm not sure the kernel will
#               buffer frames unless we explicitly added / are tracking the client?
#
#
#
# CLIENT: We try to put the interface into active monitor mode and otherwise create an AP:
#
#     - To make the interface acknowledge frames we try to put it into active monitor mode.
#       Few interfaces support this, so as a fallback we create an AP that also advertises
#       the rogue beacon on the real channel.
#       The downside of both approaches is that with them we can only reliably target a
#       single client at a time. The only known method to avoid this is to use MAC address
#       masks as done in Modwifi (https://github.com/vanhoefm/modwifi) but that requires
#       specific (older) dongles and kernel/driver modifications.
#
#     - A virtual monitor interface is used to recieve and inject arbitrary frames.
#
#     - TODO: Do we need to register/connect to the AP to get rate control working?
